\description{Solve the squared hinge loss interval regression problem for one
\code{regularization} parameter: w* = argmin_w L(w) + \code{regularization} *
||w||_1 where L(w) is the average squared hinge loss with respect
to the \code{targets}, and ||w||_1 is the L1-norm of the weight vector
(excluding the first element, which is the un-regularized
intercept or bias term). This function performs no scaling of
input \code{features}, and is meant for internal use only! To learn a
regression model, try \code{\link{IntervalRegressionCV}} or
\code{\link{IntervalRegressionUnregularized}}.}
\usage{IntervalRegressionInternal(features, 
    targets, initial.param.vec, 
    regularization, threshold = 0.001, 
    max.iterations = 1000, 
    weight.vec = NULL, 
    Lipschitz = NULL, 
    verbose = 2, margin = 1, 
    biggest.crit = 100)}
\arguments{
  \item{features}{Scaled numeric feature matrix (problems x \code{features}). The first
column/feature should be all ones and will not be regularized.}
  \item{targets}{Numeric target matrix (problems x 2).}
  \item{initial.param.vec}{initial guess for weight vector (\code{features}).}
  \item{regularization}{Degree of L1-regularization.}
  \item{threshold}{When the stopping criterion gets below this \code{threshold}, the
algorithm stops and declares the solution as optimal.}
  \item{max.iterations}{If the algorithm has not found an optimal solution after this many
iterations, increase \code{Lipschitz} constant and \code{max.iterations}.}
  \item{weight.vec}{A numeric vector of weights for each training example.}
  \item{Lipschitz}{A numeric scalar or NULL, which means to compute \code{Lipschitz} as the
mean of the squared L2-norms of the rows of the feature matrix.}
  \item{verbose}{Cat messages: for restarts and at the end if >= 1, and for every
iteration if >= 2.}
  \item{margin}{Margin size hyper-parameter, default 1.}
  \item{biggest.crit}{Restart FISTA with a bigger \code{Lipschitz} (smaller step size) if crit
gets larger than this.}
}

\value{Numeric vector of scaled weights w of the affine function f_w(X) =
X \%*\% w for a scaled feature matrix X with the first row entirely
ones.}
